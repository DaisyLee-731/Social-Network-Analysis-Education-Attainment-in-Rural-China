# Social-Network-Analysis-Education-Attainment-in-Rural-China
This is one of my empirical undergraduate papers, aiming to investigate the relationship between the accumulation of social capital (measured by social network density) and individuals' college participation in rural China. 

An instrumental variable is proposed in this paper to deal with endogeneity issues. 

The causal relationship between the proposed two variables is established, after a series of sensitivity checks and robustness checks.
